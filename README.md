## Title: Identification of Ideal Locations for Student Accommodation

> Data science approach to identify best locations around Nottingham Trent University to start student accommodation business.


### Business Problem
**Business Problem: Identify ideal locations around Nottingham Trent University (NTU) such that the locations have access to wide range of amenities, are safe and are at close proximity to the university (within 5 km).**

In this project, I utilise Foursquare API to explore neighbourhoods around NTU to provide consulta- tion for the best locations for investing in student accommodation. The solution provided will be useful for business owners to choose locations around NTU to provide accommodation services to the university students. Mainly, availability of facilities around the locations and the number of criminal events reported are taken into account. Usually, students prefer to live in a close proximity to university campuses so the locations are restricted within 5 km radius of NTU.
